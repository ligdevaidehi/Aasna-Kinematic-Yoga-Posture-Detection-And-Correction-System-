# Aasna: Kinematic Yoga Posture Detection and Correction System using CNN

## Overview

Aasna is a cutting-edge system designed to detect and correct yoga postures using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The system aims to assist yoga practitioners in achieving correct postures, provide real-time feedback, and promote a healthier and more effective yoga practice.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Collects images and videos of various yoga postures.
- **Preprocessing**: Ensures consistent input size and quality with data augmentation techniques.
- **CNN Model**: Classifies and detects different yoga postures.
- **Posture Detection**: Real-time detection and classification of yoga postures.
- **Posture Correction**: Provides feedback and corrective suggestions to improve posture alignment.
- **User Interface**: User-friendly interface for uploading videos or using a live camera feed.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Visual cues, textual, and audio feedback with corrective suggestions.
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitors improvement over time.
- **Integration with Wearable Devices**: Optional integration for more accurate posture detection using additional sensor data.
